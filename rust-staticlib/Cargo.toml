# Generated by rust-staticlib-gen for opam package: ocaml-rs-smartptr

# This crate depends on all Rust crates, that were specified via
# `x-rust-stubs-crate` metadata field in opam files in the dependencie tree of your
# project opam file.
#
# Dependencies are listed as exact version matches, and versions are taken
# verbatim from corresponding opam package versions. This is done this way to
# ensure 100% compatibility between OCaml bindings and their Rust stubs crates.
# In case of any confclits at cargo level, they should be resolved at opam
# level, and this file needs to be re-generated.
